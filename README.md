# ANN_K-fold_cross_validation_on-Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-dataset

A Dense Neural Network is modelled to predict whether a breast tumor is Malignant or Benign depending on 30 features of the dataset provided.
The model so prepared is cross validated using the K-Fold Stratified Cross Validation method.
The data feature values are standarized and the y_label values are converted from M/B to 0/1.
